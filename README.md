# Overview
"Clan Quest Mod" is a fan-made modification by Burgermeister for Troika's "Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines" built on top of Wesp5's Unofficial Patch. Unfortunately, the last version of CQM (4.1) was built on top of UP 9.2, whereas the "Homosexual" history was not added to Unnofficial Patch Plus until version 9.9.

"CQM Homosexuality" is a project to backport and fully implement the "Homosexual" history into CQM 4.1 running the provided version of Unnofficial Patch Plus 9.2.

"CQM Homosexuality" is currently being developed without the use of any of CQM's optional mods, such as "Camarilla Edition Lite". There is then a potential for conflicts with their use, I plan on looking into providing alternative versions for this if it is the case but for the time being am focusing on development under minimum conditions.

# Installation
Install CQM 4.1 (https://www.moddb.com/mods/vtmb-clan-quest-mod) into your "Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines" game folder, then extract the release file on top of your CQM file, allowing it to overwrite as needed.

Given the function of the mod, I recommend using it only on new save games.

# Uninstallation
Delete your game's "CQM" folder and reinstall "Clan Quest Mod".

# Status
Currently, "CQM Homosexuality" fully backports Unnofficial Patch Plus' "Homosexual" history as it exists in the UP 9.9. This includes the presence of the history, its function in the model and voice of the player's sire in the opening scene, and its effects on the player's interactions with Jeanette and Romero. It does not yet affect any of the content added by CQM on top of the Unnofficial Patch.
