# VTMB CQM Homosexuality
"Clan Quest Mod" is a fan-made modification by Burgermeister for Troika's "Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines" built on top of Wesp5's Unofficial Patch. Unfortunately, the last version of CQM (4.1) was built on top of the UP 9.2, whereas the "Homosexuality" history was not added to the Unnofficial Patch Plus until version 9.9.

"CQM Homosexuality" is a project to backport and fully implement the "Homosexuality" history into CQM 4.1.

# Status
Currently, "CQM Homosexuality" fully backports the Unnofficial Patch Plus' "Homosexuality" history as it exists in the UP 9.9. This includes the presence of the history, its function in the model and voice of the player's sire in the opening scene, and its effects on the player's interactions with Jeanette and Romero. It does not yet affect any of the content added by CQM on top of the Unnofficial Patch.

# Installation
Install CQM 4.1 (https://www.moddb.com/mods/vtmb-clan-quest-mod) into your "Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines" game folder, then extract the release file on top of your CQM file, allowing it to overwrite as needed.

# Uninstallation
Delete your game's "CQM" folder and reinstall "Clan Quest Mod".

# Credits
Burgermesiter for his creation of "Clan Quest Mod" and Wesp5 for his development of the Unnofficial Patch.
